I am a PhD student in applied maths at [Centre Borelli](https://centreborelli.ens-paris-saclay.fr) (ENS Paris-Saclay) under the supervision of Alain Trouv√©. Previously, I was a visiting scholar at Florida State University and at John Hopkins University and I worked with [Martin Bauer](https://www.math.fsu.edu/~bauer/) and [Nicolas Charon](https://www.math.uh.edu/~ncharon/index.html).

My main research interests span infinite dimensional geometry, Lie groups, and shape analysis. More specificaly, I am currently working on Hamiltonian dynamics induced by right-invariant metrics on infinite dimensional and some applications to medical imaging and fluid dynamics. More information about my research and a complete list of my publications can be found on my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wxi8-wUAAAAJ&hl=fr) page and [here](/)
